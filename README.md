This Project Using a RFM(Recency, Frequency, dan Monetary) RFM a method in Customer Relationship Management for segmentation
Recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM) is a marketing analysis tool used to identify a firm's best clients based on the nature of their spending habits.
An RFM analysis evaluates clients and customers by scoring them in three categories: how recently they've made a purchase, how often they buy, and the size of their purchases.
RFM analysis helps firms reasonably predict which customers are likely to purchase their products again, how much revenue comes from new (versus repeat) clients, and how to turn occasional buyers into habitual ones.
